                <h1>Chapter 1: <span><u>The Curse</u></span></h1>

                <p>Aunt behaviour for Sharanya was getting rude everyday. Sharanya wasn't having any idea how to react on it.
                    <br>Sharanya was debonair nature so she adore to make everyone smile. No matter how difficult for her but she
                    <br>was giving her best to make others smile. Nowadays her aunt behaviour was breaking Sharanya. She wasn't able to
                    <br>express herself. Still she was trying to make everyone happy. Day to day her aunt tourture was increasing she just
                    <br>keep tolerating everything. But one day she is done and was trying to end herself. But God is always there to help.
                    <br>Class 9th she got a friend named Avantika. Whensoever Sharanya was done, Avantika use to charge her. Everything
                    <br>went well until class 10. Sharanya came to know the truth of her birth & her real parents from her cousin.
                    <br>She verified it with her father's mother. Exact same she told to Sharanya. Now Sharanya unable to undestand 
                    <br>what to do. She just kept everything inside her. She was still in the pain of this truth and class X board exams
                    <br>come. Sharanya managed her feelings and tried her best to give the exams. But when she was preparing for exams She
                    <br>came to know about the affair of her Aunt.
